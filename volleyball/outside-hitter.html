    <h1>Outside Hitter</h1>

    <p>
        The outside hitter, also known as the left-side hitter, is one of the most important offensive players on the court. 
        They are responsible for attacking from the left side, playing solid defense in the back row, 
        and often receiving serves. Their versatility makes them key players in both offense and defense.
