                    <h3>Work</h3>
                    My name is Mario Østervold. Im 18 years old attending Amalie Skram's upper secondary school. While schoolwork is my first priority, i already have work experience. In the summer of 2021 and 2022 i fished for Havforskningsinstituttet at Austevoll, while in the summer of 2023, they didnt have any available work. Therefore i got a job at Austevollsbadet, where im a lifeguard. Im still employed there part time. 
                    <h3>Code</h3>
                    Last year, i attended a coding class at Amalie Skram upper secondary school. In the class i learned python and did a few projects you can find on my github profile. As of now im learning HTML, CSS and Javascript.
